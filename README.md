Creating a virtual game named Tamagotchi.

This app is a virtual game that requires you to take care of a pet. The pet might be whichever animal you want it to be. It must be taken care of not all the time, but you must check it at least every hour. The game requires you to take feed, clean/ bath, and play with the pet.
The catch is that if your pet is not fed it will not allow you to play with it. If it is not clean, it will not eat or play. So, you must balance all these responsibilities. The other thing is that if you do not attend the game for more than an hour, the pet dies or all points of the feed, bath, and play decrease. Therefore, the game must be attended.
The game has 10 points for each responsibility and does not get higher than that. If one of the responsibilities is the point decrease, then after you attend that responsibility, you will be rewarded with points. This results in points increasing.
This app should have five screens.  The first one must be the welcoming screen, the second one must be the screen that displays the points, the third one must be the feed screen followed by the bath screen. The last one will be the play.  When clicking the feed button/ it must be able to change the pet’s image to match the feeding action icon, and update the pet’s status value, for instance hunger status, health status, and cleanliness status at the end accordingly.  
This game is not complicated because all you just do is taking care of the pet. You also need to keep track of the points because the points must balance.
